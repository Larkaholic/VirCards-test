# **App Name**: VisceraVerse

## Core Features:

- 3D Intestine Model: Interactive 3D model of human intestines using React Three Fiber.
- Drag and Drop: Drag and drop functionality for manipulating and positioning intestine components.
- Interactive Highlighting: Highlighting of specific regions or segments of the intestines to identify pathologies or areas of interest.
- Data Overlay: Add tags onto the surface of the 3D intestine which describe a region
- Scenario Generator: Generate a fictional autopsy scenario, including cause of death, time of death, and injuries sustained using an LLM tool. Data and results will change the properties of the model and which highlights appear
- Autopsy Guide: Guide for the generated scenario
- Scoring: Measure user interaction metrics (e.g., how long they looked at an element or part, mouse location when solving autopsy) in order to determine a user's grade on a procedure.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark purple (#5A3A8A) for a serious, scientific, and slightly morbid feel.
- Background color: Dark gray (#2B2B2B) to provide contrast and a professional look.
- Accent color: Teal (#45B6FE) to highlight interactive elements and provide a modern touch.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, for headlines.
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for body text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use detailed, anatomical icons for internal organs and autopsy tools.
- Smooth transitions and subtle animations for a polished and professional feel.
- A clean, organized layout that separates the 3D model from instructional text and controls.
